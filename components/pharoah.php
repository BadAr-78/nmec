Amenhotep II left behind many major monuments, including a large number of statues. His memorial temple at Kom el-Hettan was fronted by huge statues now known as the Colossi of Memnon.

She was the daughter of Thutmose I and his principal queen Ahmose, who may have been part of the Ahmosid dynasty that founded the New Kingdom. As a young girl, she was married to her half-brother, Thutmose II, who came to the throne after the death of their father, Thutmose I. When Thutmose II died, he left behind daughters and a son by a minor wife named Iset, Thutmose III, who was too young to rule on his own. Hatshepsut became Egypt\'s regent, monarch in all but name. For several years, she ruled the country on behalf of her stepson. In ancient Egypt, a woman could not become ruler, as the role of pharaoh was seen as exclusively masculine. However, the king could not rule without a wife by his side to assume the role of the Great Queen, symbolizing the balance of male and female and underscoring the dual nature of the created cosmos. Hatshepsut, as the daughter of a pharaoh and his Great Royal Wife, could claim the purest of royal bloodlines, and soon declared herself pharaoh, despite her gender. In her memorial temple at Deir el-Bahari, she devoted an entire wall of one portico to the mystical story of her divine birth, showing the great god Amun-Re visiting her mother, Ahmose, in the night. This was meant to express her legitimacy, and prove that her rule over Egypt was pre-ordained. Hatshepsut is remembered as a prolific builder who commissioned countless construction projects. Her most famous are the Red Chapel in Kamak, her work in the restoration of the Mut Precinct at Karnak, the temple of Pakhet at Beni Hasan, and the obelisks she had quarried at Aswan for the glory of Amun-Re. She also re-established trade networks that had been disrupted during the turmoil and foreign occupation of the Second Intermediate Period. Another area of her mortuary temple was dedicated to depictions of an expedition she sponsored to the Land of Punt (which lies between modern Ethiopia and Sudan), to obtain ivory, resins, ebony, spices, and other valuable spooß After ruling for about 22 years, she disappeared from the historical record, and Thutmose lII, junior king during her tenure, became sote pharaoh.

He successfully asserted Egyptian dominance in the Levant (modern-day Syria-Palestine), his battle at Megiddo, an important city in ancient Palestine, is considered a model of military strategy.
                  The king, who was keen on leaving his own mark on his expanding empire, was extremely, active all over Egypt and Nubia. Under his guidance, Egypt carried out at least 17 major military expeditions. He also left behind evidence of major building programs, including the \'Akh-Menu,\' a temple in the precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak in which he carved a king list recording the names of his predecessors. Thutmose Ill was also known for his interest in the natural world; at Karnak, he commissioned the construction of the \'botanical garden\', a chamber decorated with images of the exotic flora and fauna he and his troops had encountered in their foreign campaigns. Including his joint reign with Hatshepsut, he ruled for 54 years over a prosperous and powerful Egypt. His tomb in the Valley of the Kings, KV 34, is remarkable for its decoration, which illustrates the journey of the sun god through the 12 hours of the night in a style that mimics drawing on papyrus. He was originally buried in a cartouche- shaped sarcophagus, which stilf lies in his burial chamber. However like many of the other royal mummies, he was eventually taken to the mummy cache at Deir el-Bahan.',

The Sphinx appeared to him in his dreams and instructed him to clear away the sand that covered its body, in return, he would be made the next pharaoh. This suggests that he might not have been the legitimate crown prince, but that he usurped the throne in some way. Thutmose IV carried out at least one campaign to Nubia, which may have been more of a police action than anything else, He is known to have established peaceful relations with the Mitanni, Egypt\'s greatest rivals to the northeast, marrying a Mitanni princess. He is credited with building a double portico in the court fronting the Fourth Pylon at Karnak also at Karnak, he built a small chapel of Egyptian alabaster. He was originally buried in KV 43, but was moved to the tomb of Amenhotep l sometime after Year 13 of Smendes.',
