Both were venerated for centuries, with their cult especially prominent at Deir el-Medina, the village of the artisans who built the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Amenhotep I’s original tomb is mentioned in the Abbott Papyrus, but its location is still unknown. Some scholars believe that it is located in Dra Abu el-Naga, while others identify it with a small tomb in the Valley of the Kings.

But his father the king, who was the lhappy with his son\'s bravery, presented him with a gift of horses and made him responsible for the stables. He maintained the borders of the empire solidified by his father and fought campaigns in the Levant and in Nubia, securing wealth and power for Egypt.

Amenhotep II left behind many major monuments, including a large number of statues. His memorial temple at Kom el-Hettan was fronted by huge statues now known as the Colossi of Memnon. Among the many sculptures found here were hundreds of figures of the lioness-goddess Sekhmet (more statues of whom were found in the Mut complex, dedicated to the consort of the god Amun-Re, at Karnak). This fierce deity had the power to defeat disease, and as such was often invoked for healing. One theory suggests that Amenhotep IIl might have been ill during his last years of rule, or even that there was a plague threatening Egypt\'s people, and that the sculptures were carved for protection. At the southern end of the Theban necropolis, Amenhotep III built a vast ceremonial complex for the celebration of his Sed Festival, a ceremony designed to rejuvenate him and prove he was still fit to rule after thirty years as king. A colossal statue of Amenhotep IIl and Tiye, a symbol of their strong bond and eternal power, is an iconic sight at the Egyptian Museum, Cairo.

She was the daughter of Thutmose I and his principal queen Ahmose, who may have been part of the Ahmosid dynasty that founded the New Kingdom. As a young girl, she was married to her half-brother, Thutmose II, who came to the throne after the death of their father, Thutmose I. When Thutmose II died, he left behind daughters and a son by a minor wife named Iset, Thutmose III, who was too young to rule on his own. Hatshepsut became Egypt\'s regent, monarch in all but name. For several years, she ruled the country on behalf of her stepson. In ancient Egypt, a woman could not become ruler, as the role of pharaoh was seen as exclusively masculine. However, the king could not rule without a wife by his side to assume the role of the Great Queen, symbolizing the balance of male and female and underscoring the dual nature of the created cosmos. Hatshepsut, as the daughter of a pharaoh and his Great Royal Wife, could claim the purest of royal bloodlines, and soon declared herself pharaoh, despite her gender. In her memorial temple at Deir el-Bahari, she devoted an entire wall of one portico to the mystical story of her divine birth, showing the great god Amun-Re visiting her mother, Ahmose, in the night. This was meant to express her legitimacy, and prove that her rule over Egypt was pre-ordained. Hatshepsut is remembered as a prolific builder who commissioned countless construction projects. Her most famous are the Red Chapel in Kamak, her work in the restoration of the Mut Precinct at Karnak, the temple of Pakhet at Beni Hasan, and the obelisks she had quarried at Aswan for the glory of Amun-Re. She also re-established trade networks that had been disrupted during the turmoil and foreign occupation of the Second Intermediate Period. Another area of her mortuary temple was dedicated to depictions of an expedition she sponsored to the Land of Punt (which lies between modern Ethiopia and Sudan), to obtain ivory, resins, ebony, spices, and other valuable spooß After ruling for about 22 years, she disappeared from the historical record, and Thutmose lII, junior king during her tenure, became sote pharaoh. It was once thought that she might have been murdered on the orders of this king, but it is more likely that she simply died from natural causes.

Ramses Il is remembered as a great warrior and recorded his Year 5 Battle of Kadesh, in which he fought against the Hittites. Although the actual outcome of the battle was a draw, the king was excessively proud of his personal bravery and military prowess, bragging that he had singlehahdedly saved Egypt from what might have been a terrible defeat. He continued to skirmish with the Hittites for many years, but eventually signed a peace treaty-the first known in history-with their king, and married his daughter to seal the newly-founded alliance. The tomb of the ambassador who delivered the peace treaty has been found at Saggara. This pharaoh built,temples almost everywhere in Egypt, as well as in Nubia. The most famous of his projects are Abu Simbel, the Ramesseum (dedicated to his mortuary cult), and his additions to Luxor Temple. He also founded a new capital, Pi-Ramses, in the Delta.

For the next two decades, the young monarch grew into what would become his eventual role as one of the great warrior pharaohs of the New Kingdom.

Under his sole rule, the empire reached its farthest extent, from the Euphrates in the north to the Fourth Cataract of the Nile in the south. He successfully asserted Egyptian dominance in the Levant (modern-day Syria-Palestine), his battle at Megiddo, an important city in ancient Palestine, is considered a model of military strategy.
  The king, who was keen on leaving his own mark on his expanding empire, was extremely, active all over Egypt and Nubia. Under his guidance, Egypt carried out at least 17 major military expeditions.
